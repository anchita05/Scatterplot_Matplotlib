This project was made for Coursera's Applied Plotting, Charting and Data Represenatation Course. 
The Scatterplot is created using Python's Matplotlib library, learnt during the course.

Problem Statement from the course

    This assignment requires that you find at least two datasets on the web which are related, and that you visualize 
    these datasets to answer the assignment question. You are free to utilize datasets with any location or domain.
What I chose?

    “How can Temperature level and PM2.5 level be related for urban areas in India like Delhi?”
Objective: 

    To analyze the relationship between temperature levels and PM2.5 levels in urban areas of India, specifically 
    focusing on Delhi, using Python’s matplotlib library for data visualization.
Context: 

    Delhi, like many urban areas in India, faces significant air pollution challenges, with PM2.5 (particulate 
	matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers) being a major pollutant. PM2.5 levels are influenced by 
	various factors, including temperature. Understanding this relationship can help in developing strategies to 
	mitigate air pollution.
